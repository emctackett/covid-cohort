# CS361 - COVIDCoach
This is a project built for Oregon State University's CS361 course - Software Engineering I.

There are three primary goals for COVIDCoach
(1) help people avoid catching the virus,
(2) help people learn about the virus, and
(3) help people stay connected and in touch with others. 

## Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)


## Authors
* **Elizabeth Tackett** - [emctackett](https://github.com/emctackett)

## How To Run COVIDCoach
To run the project, first clone it OR download the source code zip file from the GitHub release and unzip the file. Then `cd` into the covid-cohort directory using a command line interface tool:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emctackett/covid-cohort.git
cd covid-cohort
``` '

### npm

Next, install and update necessary dependencies with npm by typing:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the application with npm by typing:
```bash
npm start
```

A tab should automatically open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/ where you can view the site.

### yarn

You can also install dependencies and run this app using yarn:
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Both npm and yarn will open COVIDCoach at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a new tab of your default browser.

To end the program, go back to the terminal and press `ctrl` + `c`, where the program will confirm that you want to terminate the job.


## React App Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
